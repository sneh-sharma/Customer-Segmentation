## About the Project
This project performs customer segmentation using machine learning.
K-Means clustering is used to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Objective
To divide customers into different groups so that businesses can
understand customer behavior and improve marketing strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
